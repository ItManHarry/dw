'''
The topic guide on Djangoâ€™s database-abstraction API described
the way that you can use Django queries that create, retrieve,
update and delete individual objects. However, sometimes you will
need to retrieve values that are derived by summarizing or
aggregating a collection of objects. This topic guide describes
the ways that aggregate values can be generated and returned
using Django queries.
